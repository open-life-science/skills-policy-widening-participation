# Skills Policy Award for the theme 'Widening Participation'

*Public repository to share resources from the OLS project on 'Widening Participation in Higher Education' funded under the Turing's Skills Policy Award.*
## Background

Diversity amongst staff and students in higher education is [demonstrably unequal](https://www.ecu.ac.uk/about-us/he-equality-challenges), both in gender balance and ethnic balance. Similarly, open source software developers self-report to be over 90% male and &lt;[15% self-report as BME](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qps53). Numerous national and international studies highlight that women, certain ethnic minorities, people with disabilities and those from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds[ are underrepresented in education, training and employment related to STEM](https://royalsociety.org/-/media/Royal_Society_Content/policy/projects/leading-way-diversity/picture-uk-scientific-workforce/070314-diversity-report.pdf). With growing applications of data science and AI technology in decision making and automation, as per [ONS analysis](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/whichoccupationsareathighestriskofbeingautomated/2019-03-25), women and young people are most at risk of unemployment. It is unsurprising that lack of diversity among tech workforce directly reflects on the technology and continues to disadvantage populations from marginalised communities who already experience systemic barriers to participation. 

Through this project, OLS aims to address the above described challenge by diversifying skills for the next generation of diverse workforce in areas utilising open data practices, providing them with the opportunity to take new career directions and gain funding through collaboration, leadership and entrepreneurship. 

OLS’ goals and operations directly align with the theme of ‘widening participation’. OLS embodies principles of EDIA and is deeply committed to achieving AI and data literacy for everyone, operationalising the[ AI Council Roadmap](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-roadmap) recommendations mentioned under this theme.
